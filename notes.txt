Wondering why my test waveform isn't identical to my cosine wave form. I calculate the
period in the same way. 

ANSWER: I was using the 'float' version of the cos/sin functions in one case (add_cos)
and the 'double' version of them in the test case (add_test) so basically double the
dynamic range. Fixing that gets them a lot closer, but the test one has better
"nominal" dynamic range, its noise is around -300 dB but it has spurs up to -220DB,
whereas the one using the functions directly has its noise at -250 dB with no spurs
really in the -220 range. 

So one question answered, and another created.

Then we have the question of the 'infinity' answers on the FFT when the function is
exactly 1/8th the FFT bins. That is a different question.

New problem: Changing the sample rate to 10000 generates a *very* odd FFT plot. It looks
very much like something with very wide skirts. Although the phase noise should not be that bad.

With an 8912 sample rate I get the expected FFT, with a 10000 sample rate, I get a very weird
FFT. What is more, the frequency along the bottom doesn't seem to change (but that might be
part of the problem)

That said, the test wave form and trancendental generated waveform generate the EXACT same
FFT (which is something I would expect) except they just barely touch 0 dB after going up to
60 dB.

Moving the sample rate to 10240 gets a back to an "expected" FFT (one peak, a lot of 
noise in the -220 to -300 dB range.

Frequency and sample rate are interacting in a very very weird way. I expect I'm using
sample rate when I should be using bins in my FFT calculation.

Added Hann window and Blackman-Harris window. Not sure if I can figure out a Kaiser-Bessleman
window. These two are pretty good and serve to illustrate the problem and the fix.

Add DFT code and examples.

So article outline:
	Correlation as a way to "pick out" frequencies in a signal.
	Slewing a sinusoid fro DC to 'N' to map out sinusoids, the DFT
	Signals and Harmonics - what makes a waveform a waveform?
	Doing that "Fast" with the Fast Fourier Transform
	Gotchas and Spectral Leakage
	Adding a "window" to the FFT
		The Hann window
		The Blackman-Harris 4 element window
	Conclusions and next steps.
