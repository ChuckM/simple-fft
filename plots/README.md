Plot Directory
--------------

When the tools generate a gnuplot they drop it into this
directory as a .data file. You can visualize the plot
by using the command `gnuplot < plots/foo.data`.

Interesting question to split the plot data from the
terminal data, thus allowing for easy swapping between
interactive viewing of the plot and publication views.
